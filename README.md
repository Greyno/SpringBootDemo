The project uses IntelliJ (with Maven and SpringBoot. Postman is also used to see the results of Crud messages (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE). These can also be seen on the local host, but if that is not available, Postman can be used.

In order to create an interface that would be able to read MySQL data, in IntelliJ, we can go from the FakeStudentDaoImplementation by doing Refactor>Extract>Interface...
Select all of the methods in the fake data and rename the class to StudentDao. This will create an interface named StudetnDao.
